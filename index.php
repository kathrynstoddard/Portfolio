            <h3>UX Design</h3>
            <p>Whether mocking up a project in Sketch, Axure or my favorite text-editor, the user is always in mind. Usability isn’t a luxury, it’s a necessity.</p>

            <h3>Google Analytics &amp; Tag Manager</h3>
            <p>During discovery of a project, Google Analytics is an important tool for me to find trends and areas to research further for improvement. After a project is completed, I continue to use analytics to look for areas to improve.</p>

        <h3>Workflow &amp; Process</h3>
        <p>Workflow is an important process to every ux designer. Mine starts with understanding the purpose of a website or web application by asking questions to understand requirements from stakeholders &amp; users, digging into available analytics for user behavior and researching best practices for usability within the project's domain and target audience.</p>
        <p>Once the scope of a project is determined, I develop user flow and sketch designs to create a strong foundation for mockups and prototypes to help communicate ideas and interactions with clients, UI designers, project managers and developers.</p>
        <p>Design is never completely done at this point as there is always room for improvement. During development and after launch, I continue to work with clients and developers to continue to improve the user experience.</p>
